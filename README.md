# JWT WebAPI Template

## What is this?

While developing a .Net Framework WebAPI, I found few tutorials / little documentation that instructed how to set up custom authentication with WebAPI.  I was asked to develop a [JWT](https://jwt.io/) based authentication for a WebAPI.  I wanted to learn Identity and how it works (so that part is not custom) but I found the pieces necessary to do so and will document them.  

## Warning 
Use of JWT [has some issues](http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/06/13/stop-using-jwt-for-sessions/) so they should probably not be used for sessions as this project does.
